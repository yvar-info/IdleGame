I made this idlegame to test myself on my data handling skills in javascript with JSON data..

The reason why I made a clicker game. Is because I can add dynamic upgrades that are JSON strings. Which I then copy and manipulate. Then for updating this data I will use javascript. Then I also need to compare which upgrades I have added to the game.

Basically what I have done here is easier to understand written out.
I made a data set with JSON which I then call with javascript. Manipulated values and other data. Saved these to local storage. And then compare which ones were already saved and then skip these to add the next one.

This might not seem useful. But since I mainly work with PHP, being able to manipulate data in a JSON format and save these temporarily is useful for dynamic front end elements.

Things like carts. Changing widgets. Or other values that should be dynamic are easier to maintain that way. So we do not need to force reload the entire page to update a small amount of data.

That is basically the reason why I made all of my minigames and projects. For this specific reason. To test my skills and learn how to work with certain objectives. Within the root of a language without any addons..

On top of that I wanted to challenge myself with this project to not use CHATGPT. Not because I can't and won't use it. But because I know that I am capable enough to work without it.

Would I use it again? Yes, but I would rely on myself more and only use it as a last result. The same reason why I ended up using it once for this project.

The only time I used chatGPT is to understand why my include. Did not work on my json data the way I expected it to work. Turns out I had to turn it into a string. And includes is not only an array selector but also a string selector. With this knowledge I went and added quotes around to make sure we got the value and not just the name. Which is not a perfect
Solution, but I am only making these projects to challenge myself. I would not ship this in production if I could find a better solution. However, sometimes you need to work within time limits and you do not have the time to find a perfect solution. In this situation I would add a comment and then make sure to emphasize that this solution might need a 2nd look at it.

There were a few moments I had lost hope in myself, but then again you aren't a programmer until you have developed a form of imposter syndrome. I have learned a lot. So much even that I am proud of myself. For tackling these projects.

In this journey of developing 3 small games I realised something.
well a few things.
- I can programm
- I know what i write
- I love this type of work more than I thought
- I am so much more satisfied with what I made than I could ever imagine.
- I do not need chatGPT to make complex and working website code.

I am so happy I challenged myself I. feel so more comfortable and sure of claiming I am a developer.
My next challenges may make me question my compentence. but I have proved to myself that a moment of doubt is healthy.
and I have more skills than I would care to admit!
